### Hi there 👋🏻
- 🕵🏻 _Who is Ilia?_ I'm a doctoral student at the University of Lausanne, a huge fan of open source projects (otherwise, why I would be on Github, right?!).
- 🌱 _What is he into?_ I do research on multi-modal machine learning (a.k.a multi-view learning or multi-input models) with a focus on the integration of structured and unstructured data through novel interpretable deep learning techniques.
- 📫 _How to reach him?_ If you wanted grab a virtual coffee or just wanted to get in touch, you can drop me an email at ilia.azizi@unil.ch
